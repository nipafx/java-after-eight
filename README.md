# Java After Eight/Eleven

Nice Java 8/11 code base that gets way nicer with Java 9-17 and beyond.

Code base for [my talk _Java After Eight_](https://nipafx.dev/talk-java-after-n/).
See the `java-$VERSION-guide.md` files [in the slides repo](https://github.com/nipafx/slides/tree/master/java-after-eight) to see which Java 9+ features go where.
For a more structured approach to these features, check my [Java X demo repository](https://github.com/nipafx/demo-java-x).
