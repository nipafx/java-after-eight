Many projects are still on Java 8, some already on 11 and yet, these days Java 16 gets released!
Java's releases between 9 and 16 have a lot in stock - in this talk you'll learn about...

* new language features like sealed types, records, switch expressions, `var`, and more
* new APIs like stack walking and the reactive HTTP/2 client
* the additions to existing APIs, like `Stream` and `Optional`
* other niceties like multi-release JARs and performance improvements

After this talk you will be prepared to get started with Java 16.
