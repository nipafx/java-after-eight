Most projects that updated past Java 8 decided to stick to the LTS release 11.
The new cadence created the illusion of not much happening after that, but nothing could be further from the truth - with new language features like switch expressions, text blocks, records, and sealed classes, Java is moving faster than ever.

In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 11 code base, update it to 16, and refactor it to use the new language features and APIs.
You'll be surprised how much the code changes!
