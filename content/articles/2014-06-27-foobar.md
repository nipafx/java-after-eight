Sorry, but this is no real post.
I just needed a first entry to enable the RSS feed...

But if you couldn't tell by the post's name that it will contain nothing useful, then perhaps it's not so foobar after all.
Read up on Foobar (e.g. [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo)) and use it.
Often!
Every time you're standing in front of a whiteboard or programming with someone else and you need a name that your audience should not waste their mental energy on, pick one of these: `foobar`, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, ...

And in case you are not standing in front of a whiteboard or are not programming with someone else on a regular basis... well, you should change that, it's fun!
